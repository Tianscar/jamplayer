# Java Audio Media Player
A quite simple and lightweight audio player for JavaSound, supports both streaming playback (for long music) and in-memory sound clip (for short sound effects).

The library itself can only play audio formats which JavaSound officially supported (WAV, AIFF, AIFC, AU, SND).  
If you want to play more audio formats, please see [here](https://github.com/Tianscar/javasound-spcollect), all codec SPI listed here are fully supported.

## Usage

Note you need to download test audios [here](https://github.com/Tianscar/fbodemo1) and put them to /src/test/resources to run the test code properly!
