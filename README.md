# Java Audio Media Player
A quite simple and lightweight audio player for JavaSound, supports both streaming playback (for long music) and in-memory sound pool (for short sound effects).

The library itself can only play audio formats which JavaSound officially supported (WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C, AU, SND).  
If you want to play more audio formats, please see [here](https://github.com/Tianscar/javasound-spcollect), all codec SPI listed here are fully supported.
